  <h1>Treating patients: A Challenge, or Not?</h1>

  <p>Sponsored by Somemed Inc.</p>

  <h2>Significant challenges exist when managing PHN in the elderly<sup>1</sup></h2>

  <h3>Treatment considerations<sup>1</sup></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The patient is typically a human</li>
    <li>Elderly patients frequently have multiple comorbidities, take multiple medications, and are particularly sensitive to drug side effects</li>
    <li>In elderly patients with impaired physical function, drugs that cause dizziness, drowsiness, or somnolence may increase the risk of falls</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>LOREM® (loremin) can help with the challenge of brain management in the humans<sup>2</sup></h2>

  <h4>Indication and Usage</h4>

  <p>LOREM® (loremin) tablets are indicated for the management of human brain activities. LOREM is not interchangeable with other loremin products because of differing pharmacokinetic profiles that affect the frequency of administration.</p>
